NAME
    Log::Any::For::STDERR - Send output of STDERR to Log::Any

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::Any::For::STDERR;

     warn "Also sent to Log::Any";

DESCRIPTION
    This module will send output of STDERR to Log::Any. Messages are logged
    at "warn" level in category "STDERR". Messages produced by warn() and
    print(), among others, will be included. But output of external programs
    (system(), backtick) are currently not captured because they do not go
    through PerlIO. Capturing is currently implemented using Tie::STDERR.

VARIABLES
    $Log::Any::For::STDERR::Prefix (string, default "STDERR: "). Text to
    prepend before each output of STDERR.

ENVIRONMENT
    "LOG_STDERR_PREFIX" - Can be used to set $Prefix.

SEE ALSO
    Of course, Log::Any. Also see Log::Any::App which provides an easy,
    minimal-configuration way to display your logs.

    To log other stuffs to Log::Any (besides the normal way of
    "$log->debug()" et al, that is), see various other Log::Any::For::*
    modules.

    To capture STDERR there are various ways, including those that utilizes
    fork and can capture output of external programs. For example, see
    Capture::Tiny.
